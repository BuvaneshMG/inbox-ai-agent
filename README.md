# Inbox AI Agent

An intelligent AI-powered system built with n8n to reduce manual email handling and save 40+ hours for agencies.

---

## 🚨 Problem
- Over 67% of mid-sized agencies in India lose incoming leads due to late replies and poor follow-ups, allowing competitors to act faster.
- Teams spend 5+ hours every day managing emails instead of focusing on high-priority work that actually drives the business forward.
- Critical messages like client deadlines and offers often reach leadership late, causing missed opportunities and delayed decisions.

---

## 💡 Solution
- When an email arrives, the AI agent reads and understands the message, then takes the appropriate action automatically.
- New leads receive instant replies without human intervention, ensuring competitors never get a chance to respond first.
- High-priority emails are summarized and instantly notified to leadership, so they don’t need to check every message and can focus on productive work.
